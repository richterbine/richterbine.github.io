Hello, my name is Aline Richter, I am finishing my PhD in Ecology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul at the Phylogenetic and Functional Ecology Lab (https://www.ufrgs.br/leff/). 
My research seeks to understand the relationship between species and environment, and how this affects patterns of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. To answer these questions, I use as study model the fruit-feeding butterflies, a diverse and representative group of community responses to environmental variation.
