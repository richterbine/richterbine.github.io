title: About me

Hello everyone, my name is Aline Richter, I'm from Tucunduva, a small town in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I started my academic journey at the Federal University of Pelotas where I did my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences (bachelor) (2011 to 2015) and my master's degree in Animal Biology (2016 - 2018). In 2018 I moved from Pelotas to Porto Alegre to obtain my PhD in Ecology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. My research aims to answer questions related to community ecology, mainly focused on the distinct facets of diversity. To answer these questions I use a diverse and charismatic group of insects as a model: the fruit-feeding butterflies.
