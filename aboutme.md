### Academic Career

Hello everyone, my name is Aline Richter, I'm from Tucunduva, a small town in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. I started my academic journey at the Federal University of Pelotas where I did my undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences (bachelor) (2011 - 2015) and my master's degree in Animal Biology (2016 - 2018). In 2018 I moved from Pelotas to Porto Alegre to obtain my PhD in Ecology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. 


### Research Interests

My research aims to answer questions related to community ecology, focusing primarily on the distinct facets of diversity. To answer these questions, I use a diverse and charismatic group of insects as a model: fruit-feeding butterflies.

In my Masters, I evaluated how the vertical stratification gradient affected the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity patterns of frugivorous butterflies in an Araucaria forest in southern Brazil. In my PhD, I sought to understand how different assembly processes can modify the occurrence and abundance of frugivorous butterfly species at different scales and in different biomes. 

My research correlates with the following areas:
- community assembly processes
- hierarchical community models with imperfect detection
- joint species distribution models (JSDM)
- effect of evolutionary history and functional traits on species distribution
- relationship between environmental variables and diversity patterns

In addition, I have experience with R programming, including data visualization (ggplot2), manipulation of large datasets (tidyverse and base) and manipulation of spatial objects (raster and shapefiles). I also have experience in project management (mainly related to field data collection) and I am willing to work in an interdisciplinary and diverse team.
